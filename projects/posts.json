{"type":"text","text":"In my first term at Royal Holloway, I was constantly using their shuttle bus to get to the places I needed to go however the bus timetable was this set of three unintuitive tables that didnâ€™t seem to make sense so I thought that an online tool could make this a lot easier reducing the busses you can see to the ones that are relevant to you."},

{"type":"text","text":"I used regular expressions to parse the data into a JSON format and JavaScript so the client can select the information that is needed. I used Materialize for the styling and the colour scheme was from a poster on the busses. I did all the scripting on the client-side because it was easier, it would run faster and the file size of the data was tiny."}
