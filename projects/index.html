    <p>
      Inspired by a Video by code bullet on his AI that solves minesweeper via brute-forcing all the different
      combinations of mines and recording what spaces are safe. I thought that I could improve upon this approach by
      avoiding the brute-forcing and instead just keep track of different ranges of unknown cells until the
      probability
      of there being a mine in that cell is either certainly a mine or certainly not.

    <p>
      This is an algorithm that recursively solves the Tower of Hanoi problem and visualizes the solution. This
      algorithm uses JS Promises to slow down the execution of the solution to allow it to be animated.

      I realized I had a good understanding of how 3D engines worked so I thought I would have a go at creating my own I
      was
      surprised by how well it went. This program is a rasterizing 3d engine with smooth shading and directional
      lighting it
      doesn’t support shadows. This is really just for fun as it doesn’t use any hardware acceleration or even full use
      of the
      CPU.

      During the pandemic my friends and I would play a few games online then we thought it would be cool to add our own
      cards
      to cards against humanity like with <a href="https://skribbl.io/"">skribbl.io</a> but I found no easy way to do this so
      as a way of filling the time I created an online multiplayer cards against humanity game and added some of our own
      cards. It worked really well and I’m happy with it.

      This is a tool that I created to simplify the campus bus timetable that was just given as an unintuitive
      spreadsheet
      that required to search through to find what you are looking for. Inspired by the Trainline app I show the
      upcoming
      busses from a location in chronological view allowing the user to see departure and arrival times. It even
      allows
      you to
      look back at different time or days for planning.

      As part of my software engineering module, I have created a calculator capable of interpreting infix notation
      formulas and computing its result. This calculator was made with the MVC architecture and had a graphical and
      command-line
      view.

    <p>


      As part of university coursework, I implemented a boid algorithm in python. The boid algorithm is made up of three
      rules that simulate the flocking behaviour of animals like birds and fish. This was part of a larger fishing game
      that I
      was
      a part of creating. I also greeted the wave effect that was harder than it looked the library we are using didn’t
      support
      masking so the waves are actually drawn on top of the background image in reveres order calculating the
      interactions
      of
      the waves so they don’t overlap.

    <p>
      I created my own version of Asteroids in Visual basic as I was interested in creating a game that dealt with
      collision
      handling, variable frame rates and momentum-based physics. I wrote this many years ago and was really proud so
      please
      forgive the cougar tasker in massive writing.
